Seal_rs is a set of various modules for highly concurrent applications, developing under strongly impact from the titans of the asynchronous programming world, such us Erlang, Scala and Akka.

Library includes next submodules:
* [actors](https://docs.rs/seal_rs/*/seal_rs/actors/index.html]) - Actor-based concurrent runtime, based on the untyped actors and paradigms which actively used in Akka framework and Erlang language.

* future - Future-based runtime based on the classic computer-science definition of 'Future/Promise' paradigm. ( under developing )

* executor - Set of various concurrent executors, actively used by other modules of the library, and which may be used by the user.

* testkit - Test framework for deep and seamless testing of code developed based on this library. ( under developing )

This library have a very reach documentation with big count of examples and explanations of internal library architecture. Read on the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/seal_rs/]).
